# Exploring-Ramen
Here I explore what makes ramen great and where it comes from! The data is from Kaggle

To start with I do some basic exploratory data analysis to try and better understand the data.

Generally, the data has a lot of catergorical variables, so the project focuses on feature engineering using NLP.

The final step includes trying to make a predictive model for the rating of sushi based on the features. I employ the use of a number of machine learning techniques.
