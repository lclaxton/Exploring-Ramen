# Exploring-Ramen
Here I explore what makes ramen great and where it comes from! 
- The data is from Kaggle

So far I have done some basic EDA to determine which countries are making the best ramen and which countries produce the most. 

I have also begun to use some NLP for some feature engineering. I hope to extract infomation about flavours from the description to find out what makes the best ramen. 

My final aim is to make a predictive model that can predict how highly rated a Ramen will be.
